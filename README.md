# What Is That?
It's a common babylonjs template to develop using javascript which I made for me personally (actually, i'm not a programmer)

# How Can I Use It?
Type this in terminal opened in the root directory:
```
npm install
npm start
```
it will hopefully run a dev server located at http://localhost:3000
